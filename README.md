<h1>My Car Catalog & Rent Website </h1>

The car rental site was developed to enable users to easily find the vehicle they need. Built as a Vite-based TypeScript & React project, this platform offers smooth animations with framer-motion, dynamic page transitions with React Router, and user-friendly filtering options with React Select. Advanced caching and optimized components have reduced page load times to a minimum. At the same time, Tailwind CSS has been used to provide mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility with a fully responsive design.

Users can filter vehicles by criteria such as brand, model, fuel type, and year on the main screen. There is a detail page for each vehicle; here are technical specifications such as city MPG, class, combination MPG, number of cylinders, engine volume, traction type, fuel type, highway MPG, manufacturer (make), model, transmission type, and year of production.

This site offers the information customers need with an efficient interface while being optimized for developers with modern front-end tools.
